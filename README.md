# Flow
React web app that allows users to visualize, analyze, and modify their Spotify playlists. Uses k-means clustering with silhouette coefficients for analysis and leverages a 3D force graph to show results. I can publicly deploy it to <http://catchthatflow.com> anytime, please let me know if you would like to see it!
