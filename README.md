# Flow
React web app that allows users to visualize, analyze, and modify their Spotify playlists. Uses custom k-means clustering with silhouette coefficients implemented from scratch for analysis. Leverages a 3D force graph to show results. If it's not already up and running on <http://catchthatflow.com>, let me know and I can deploy and demo it!

Current UI:
