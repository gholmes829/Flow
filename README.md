# Flow
Node JS and React JS web app deployed on AWS cloud server that allows users to visualize, analyze, and modify their Spotify playlists. Currently just lets users view and play samples of their songs and playlists. Will add a machine learning backend soon. Authenticates user using OAuth to log in to their Spotify account. Check out the app at <http://catchthatflow.com>! (server may not always be running while under development).
